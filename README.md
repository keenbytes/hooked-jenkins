# github-webhookd
Tiny API that triggers Jenkins builds from GitHub Webhook

## CLI
The following CLI commands are available:
```
github-webhookd start --config=PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE
```

## Building
Ensure you have your
[workspace directory](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) created.
Change directory to $GOPATH/github.com/mikogs/github-webhookd and run
the following commands:

```
make tools
make
```

Binary files will be build in `$GOPATH/bin/linux` and `$GOPATH/bin/darwin`
directories.

## Configuration
Look at `config-sample.json` to see how the configuration file look like. It has
changed since previous version a lot.

Now, all Jenkins details are now described in `jenkins` section. It contains 4
keys: `user`, `token`, `base_url` and `endpoints`. First two are obvious,
`base_url` is prefix for your endpoints.
`endpoints` is an array that contains objects as the following example:
```
{
  "id": "multibranch_pipeline_scan",
  "path": "/job/{{.repository}}_multibranch/build",
  "retry": {
    "delay": "10",
    "count": "5"
  },
  "success": {
    "http_status": "200"
  }
}
```
Keys of `retry` and `success` are optional. First one determines what is the
maximum number application should retry posting to and endpoint and what should
be the delay between retries. The `success` with `http_status` defined expected
HTTP Status Code (eg. 200 or 201). If different then request is considered a
failure (and will be retries if set to do so).

In `path`, any occurrence of `{{.repository}}` and `{{.branch}}` will be
replaced with repository and branch names.

In above example, application will make a `POST` request to
`base_url`+`path`.

### Trigger conditions
You can now control what repositories and branches should trigger certain
jenkins endpoints. In `config-sample.json` file, you can find the following
block:
```
{
  "endpoint": "multibranch_pipeline_scan",
  "events": {
    "push": {
      "repositories": [
        { "name": "repo1", "branches": ["branch1", "branch2"] },
        { "name": "repo2" }
      ],
      "branches": [
        { "name": "branch3", "repositories": ["repo3"] },
        { "name": "branch4" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Endpoint will be triggered only for `push` GitHub Webhook event and only when
any entry in `repositories` or `branches` matches. As you can see you can
define whole repo or repo with certain branches as well as the other way, user
branch name with optional repository names.

In addition to that you can also use new `exclude_repositories` and
`exclude_branches` blocks to determine what should be excluded.

Currently four events are available: `push`, `pull_request`, `create` and
`delete`. When `pull_request` is used you can add `actions` blocks to determine
which actions should trigger, eg.
```
    "pull_request": {
      "actions": ["opened", "reopened", "closed", "labeled", "unlabeled"]
    }
```

### Forward payload
GitHub payload can be forwarded to another URL once successfully processed.
To do this, just add the following block in your configuration (in the same
level as `triggers`):
```
"forward": [
  { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:31111", "headers": true }
],
```

## Running
Execute the binary, eg.

```
./github-webhookd start --config=PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE
```

## Development
Follow the steps mentioned in `Building` section. Additionally, there are
commands that might be useful:

* `make fmt` will use `gofmt` to reformat the code;
* `make fmtcheck` will use `gofmt` to check the code intending.
